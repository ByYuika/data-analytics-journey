Alex the Analystâ€™s Free Data Analyst Bootcamp on YouTube. I explored Alex the Analystâ€™s free <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF">data analyst bootcamp</a> on YouTube. The bootcamp covers essential tools such as SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python. tâ€™s structured in a way thatâ€™s beginner-friendly while also providing valuable insights for those looking to enhance their skills. The videos included in this bootcamp might be old-version, so I needed to find latest courses as show below.
